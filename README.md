## General Info

Having a water bucket can be extremely handy to pull off an ultimate stunt to impress your friends or even save your life. Having a lava bucket can be an awesome tactic to fend off approaching mobs or defeat your friends in an epic battle. But, what’s better than both of those? Lava and water that’s throwable!

Throwable Fluids adds throwable lava and water items. While this is the primary focus of the mod, it’s not the only thing this mod adds. This mod adds other items as well, as well as two brand new entities that can be found right in your survival world! And as an added bonus, this mod adds new food and new achievements!

## More Details

This mod adds two new entities:

- Splasher - an angelic fish found in the most common water bodies in Minecraft, including the Frozen River, River, and Ocean. This mob drops splashed gel, used for crafting throwable water, and splasher fish, a delicious delicacy!
Glow Worm - A silver-fish like mob, only less annoying because it spawns cool particles and doesn’t attack you. These mobs are immune to lava and fire. When killed, they will drop worm essence, which is used for crafting throwable lava.
The two advancements this mod adds are:

- Go With The Flow - achieved when player obtains throwable water
Hot Sauce - achieved when player obtains throwable lava
Don’t know how to craft the throwable projectiles? See the images section of the mod. Happy surviving, or trolling, or showing who’s boss, or whatever it is you’ll do!

Note: This mod only works with Fabric API and not Forge.
